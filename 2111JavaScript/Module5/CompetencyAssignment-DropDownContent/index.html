            <h4>Obtaining</h4>
            <p>I first got the iPhone 4s when I was in 8th grade. My mother swapped our phone plan to
             include data and we were able to get the iPhone 4s as part of that switch. It was really
             cool to be able to watch youtube on the go with unlimited data.
            </p>
            <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
            <p>The phone lasted until about halfway through 10th grade when the home button fell off. 
            I thought it was interisting the button was just a piece of plastic on top of a regular 
            button.

        <div class="trigger">iPhone 5s</div>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Obtaining</h4>
            <p>The iPhone 5s was the first phone I had purchased myself. I spent most of the bonus 
            from working at Lagoon on buying the phone. The 5s was super cool because it was the first 
            iPhone to have the fingerprint scanner.</p>
            <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
            <p>The death of this phone for me was sad and it was the first smartphone I broke. I accidentally 
            dropped the phone on the tile floor of a bathroom in my house and the screen shattered. I funnily 
            enough kept using the phone until the LCD panel gave out completely.</p>

    <div class="dropdown">
        <div class="trigger">iPhone 6s Plus</div>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Obtaining</h4>
            <p>This phone was so freaking large. I got the 6s Plus after the screen on the 5s I had broke. 
            The 6s is still my favorite iPhone to date as I think it was the coolest in design for the time. 
            The only downside of the size and thinness is the bending which occured in almost all of the ones produced.
            </p>
            <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
            <p>This phone lasted all the way until I was able to trade it in towards my next phone. I took amazing 
            care of this phone especially given the fact I had it through most of high school. I remember they gave me 
            full trade in value when I went to get the iPhone X.

        <div class="trigger">iPhone X</div>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Obtaining</h4>
            <p>This was the first phone Apple made with facial recognition tech. I was stoked to get it because I was 
            going to be able to get the newest phone with this groundbreaking tech. This is the phone that really got 
            me into Apple repairs and hardware specs. This was also the time I was working at Best Buy and was able to 
            do the phone repairs</p>
            <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
            <p>Along with the 6s Plus I was able to get max value of the phone for a trade in when I got the 12 pro. I 
            do really miss the design of this phone but I think the boxiness of the 12 and up is much better design for 
            modern design standards.

        <div class="content">
            <h4>Obtaining</h4>
            <p>This is my current phone and I absolutely love it. The best part about it is the upgrades Apple made to the 
            wireless charging capabilities with the introduction of the magsafe tech. Its funny to call it tech as its pretty 
            much just a magnet with a small chip reader to tell which accessory is attached to the phone at the time. I honestly 
            think most of the UI effects attached to the adding or removing of MagSafe accessories is extremely gimicky.</p>
            <h4>Plans for the Future</h4>
            <p>I really like this phone but I will most likely upgrade this fall when the next generation comes out. I recently 
            have been upgrading every other year and since I skipped the 13 I will probably pull the trigger on the next model. 
            I am excited to see what the next phone has upgrade wise. Still hoping for a variable high-refresh rate OLED screen.
